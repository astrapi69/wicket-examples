## Run Examples 

You can run every example project by doing following steps. For instance if you want to start the examples for the project jaulp-wicket-components you do this:

First change to the directory and build the project:
```bash
cd jaulp-wicket-components-examples
mvn clean install
```
Running the example:
```bash
mvn jetty:run
```
or 
```bash
mvn tomcat:run
```
Call then http://localhost:8080/

Another way is to start the example application programmaticly with jetty. In every example project there exists a start class with a main method that have the prefix Start**** and the suffix ****Examples.
